Text: Dynamic Heterogeneous Hydrogels with Cellulose Nanocrystals Most biological tissues are made out of hydrogels, which are three dimensionally (3D) crosslinked polymer chains in an aqueous microenvironment. Comparing with highly dynamic and heterogeneous natural hydrogels, such as muscle or cartilage, traditional synthetic hydrogels usually suffer from poor mechanical properties. Meanwhile, even the viscoelasticity of hydrogels is widely known, but it is lack of more sophisticated and more practical applications. In this study, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and surface-modified CNC introduce heterogeneity into synthetic hydrogels. By mimicking the dyna... Die meisten biologischen Gewebe sind aus Hydrogelen aufgebaut, welche dreidimensional quervernetzte Polymerketten in wässrigen Mikroumgebungen sind. Verglichen mit hochdynamischen und heterogenen natürlichen Hydrogelen wie beispielsweise Muskeln oder Knorpel, zeigen traditionelle synthetische Hydrogele schlechtere mechanische Eigenschaften. Mittlerweile ist das viskoelastische Verhalten von Hydrogelen weitgehend bekannt, jedoch fehlen hoch entwickelte und praxisnähere Anwendungen. In dieser Studie wurde Heterogenität in synthetische Hydrogele durch Cellulose-Nanokristalle (CNC) und oberfläc...

Text: Cooling energy solutions for buildings and cities "In the first book of its kind, this volume addresses the problem of the future cooling energy demand, the global frame defining the actual and future cooling energy consumption in the building sector. Based on the explored inputs and forecasts, a model was developed to predict the future cooling energy consumption of both the residential and commercial sector. Low energy, high-performance technological solutions for cooling energy problem in the building and city level will be presented"-- Cooling of buildings: the new energy challenge -- The impact of local and global climate change on the future energy -- Cooling consumption -- Economic and demographic parameters affecting the future cooling -- Energy consumption.

Text: Peculiar rhetoric : slavery, freedom, and the African colonization movement "The African colonization movement occupies a troubling rhetorical territory in the struggle for racial equality in the United States. For white colonizationists, the movement seemed positioned as a welcome compromise between slavery and abolition. For free blacks, colonization offered the hope of freedom, but not within America's borders. Bjørn F. Stillion Southard indicates how politics and identity were negotiated amid the intense public debate on race, slavery, and freedom in America. Operating from a position of power, white advocates argued that colonization was worthy of massive support from the federal government. Stillion Southard pores over the speeches of Henry Clay, Elias B. Caldwell, and Abraham Lincoln, which engaged with colonization during its active deliberation. Between Clay's and Caldwell's speeches at the founding of the American Colonization Society (ACS) in 1816 and Lincoln's final public effort to encourage colonization in 1862, Stillion Southard analyzes the little-known speeches and writings of free blacks who wrestled with colonization's conditional promises of freedom. He examines an array of discourses to probe the complex issues of identity confronting free blacks who attempted to meaningfully engage in colonization efforts. From a peculiarly voiced "Counter Memorial" against the ACS to the letters of wealthy black merchant Louis Sheridan negotiating for his passage to Liberia to the civically minded orations of Hilary Teage in Liberia, Stillion Southard brings to light the intricate rhetoric of blacks who addressed colonization to Africa."--Provided by publisher Introduction -- Chapter 1: Peculiar argumentation: Henry Clay, Elias B. Caldwell, and the establishment of colonization's deliberative discourse -- Chapter 2: Peculiar voice: the counter memorial of the free people of colour of the District of Columbia and the unsettling of colonization's deliberative discourse -- Chapter 3: Peculiar planning: Louis Sheridan and the negotiation of diasporic and deliberative discourse -- Chapter 4: Peculiar obligations: Hilary Teage and the constitution of civic identity in Liberia -- Chapter 5: Peculiar proposal: Abraham Lincoln and the public policy advocacy for colonization -- Chapter 6: Conclusion: middle passages, emigration, and peculiar legacies.

Text: Sonic ethnography : Identity, heritage and creative research practice in Basilicata, southern Italy Sonic ethnography explores the role of sound-making and listening practices in the formation of local identities in the southern Italian region of Basilicata. The book uses a combination of text, photography and sound recording to investigate soundful cultural performances such as tree rituals, carnivals, pilgrimages, events promoting cultural heritage and more informal musical performances. Its approach demonstrates how in the acoustic domain tradition is made and disrupted, power struggles take place and acoustic communities are momentarily brought together in shared temporality and space. This book underlines how an attention to sound-making, recording and listening practices can bring innovative contributions to the ethnography of an area that has been studied by Italian and foreign scholars since the 1950s. The approaches of the classic anthropological scholarship on the region have become one of the forces at play in a complex field where discourses on a traditional past, politics of heritage and transnational diasporic communities interact. The book’s argument is carried forward not just by textual means, but also through the inclusion of six ‘sound-chapters’, that is, compositions of sound recordings themed so as to interact with the topic of the corresponding textual chapter, and through a large number of colour photographs. Two methodological chapters, respectively about doing research in sound and on photo-ethnography, explain the authors’ approach to field research and to the making of the book

Text: Finite elements III : first-order and time-dependent PDEs This book is the third volume of a three-part textbook suitable for graduate coursework, professional engineering and academic research. It is also appropriate for graduate flipped classes. Each volume is divided into short chapters. Each chapter can be covered in one teaching unit and includes exercises as well as solutions available from a dedicated website. The salient ideas can be addressed during lecture, with the rest of the content assigned as reading material. To engage the reader, the text combines examples, basic ideas, rigorous proofs, and pointers to the literature to enhance scientific literacy. Volume III is divided into 28 chapters. The first eight chapters focus on the symmetric positive systems of first-order PDEs called Friedrichs' systems. This part of the book presents a comprehensive and unified treatment of various stabilization techniques from the existing literature. It discusses applications to advection and advection-diffusion equations and various PDEs written in mixed form such as Darcy and Stokes flows and Maxwell's equations. The remainder of Volume III addresses time-dependent problems: parabolic equations (such as the heat equation), evolution equations without coercivity (Stokes flows, Friedrichs' systems), and nonlinear hyperbolic equations (scalar conservation equations, hyperbolic systems). It offers a fresh perspective on the analysis of well-known time-stepping methods. The last five chapters discuss the approximation of hyperbolic equations with finite elements. Here again a new perspective is proposed. These chapters should convince the reader that finite elements offer a good alternative to finite volumes to solve nonlinear conservation equations.

Text: Chapter 9. Analysis of Numerical Errors This paper provides a general framework for the quantitative analysis of stochastic dynamic models. We review the convergence properties of some numerical algorithms and available methods to bound approximation errors. We then address the convergence and accuracy properties of the simulated moments. We study both optimal and non-optimal economies. Optimal economies generate smooth laws of motion defining Markov equilibria, and can be approximated by recursive methods with contractive properties. Non-optimal economies, however, lack existence of continuous Markov equilibria, and need to be simulated by numerical methods with weaker approximation properties.
