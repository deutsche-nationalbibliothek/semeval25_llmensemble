Text: Mathematics in Berlin This book is a font of information for readers interested in the mathematical past and present of Berlin. It presents a comprehensive, condensed overview of mathematical activity in Berlin, beginning with the foundation of the Academy by Leibniz and carrying over almost to the present day. Many towering figures in mathematical history worked in Berlin, and thus most of the chapters of this book are essentially concise biographies of these luminaries. The presentations are held together and complemented by a few articles examining the overall development of entire periods of scientific life at Berlin. Chapters cover the foundation of the University of Berlin, the "Golden Age" of mathematics (spanning the second half of the 19th century), the Nazi period, the development of mathematics in East and West Berlin during the political division of the city, and the merging of the formerly separated mathematical communities with the reunification of Germany

Text: Population dynamics in prehistory and early history : new approaches using stable isotopes and genetics The state of migration research has undergone rapid change since methods of analysis involving stable and radiogen isotopes and molecular genetics have started to be applied. At a conference held in Berlin in March 2010, groups whose research looks at population dynamics in pre and early, or in more recent history presented their insights about methodological approaches, research results and perspectives. The aim of this volume is to conduct a dialogue between archaeologists, geneticists and archaeometrists for the purpose of a reconstruction of (pre)historic population history.

Text: Public policy praxis : a case approach for understanding policy and analysis "Public administration and policy analysis education have long emphasized tidiness, stages, and rationality, but practitioners frequently must deal with a world where objectivity is buffeted by, repressed by, and sometimes defeated by value conflict. Politics and policy are "messy" and power explains much more about the policy process than does rationality. Public Policy Praxis, now in a thoroughly revised fourth edition, uniquely equips students to better grapple with ambiguity and complexity. By emphasizing mixed methodologies, the reader is encouraged, through the use of a wide variety of policy cases, to develop a workable and practical model of applied policy analysis. Students are given the opportunity to try out these globally applicable analytical models and tools in varied case settings (e.g., county, city, federal, international, plus urban and rural) while facing wide-ranging topics (starving farmers and the red panda in Nepal, e-cigarettes, GMOs, the gig economy, and opioid abuse) that capture the diversity and reality of public policy analysis and the intergovernmental and complex nature of politics. The fourth edition expands upon its thorough exploration of specific tools of policy analysis, such as stakeholder mapping, content analysis, group facilitation, narrative analysis, cost-benefit analysis, futuring, and survey analysis. Along with teaching "how to," the authors discuss the limitations, the practical political problems, and the ethical problems associated with different techniques and methodologies. Many new cases have been added, along with clear instructions on how to do congressional research and a Google Trends analysis. An expanded online Teaching Appendix is included for adopters, offering original cases, answers to problems, alternative approaches to case use, teaching exercises, student assignments, pedagogical ideas, and supplemental material directly tied to concepts covered in the text. With an easily accessible and conversational writing style, Public Policy Praxis is an ideal textbook for undergraduate and graduate courses in public policy analysis, community planning, leadership, social welfare policy, educational policy, family policy, and special seminars"--

Text: Financial crisis: Deposit insurance and related financial safety net aspects Government provision of a financial safety net for banks and other financialinstitutions has been a key element of the policy response to the current financialcrisis. In the process, the design of many safety net elements, such as depositinsurance, has been redrawn in many jurisdictions. In particular, governmentsextended existing guarantees and introduced new ones. While these measures didnot address the root causes of the lack of confidence, they were neverthelesshelpful in avoiding a further accelerated loss of confidence, thus buying valuabletime.

Text: Verzerrter Recall als potentielles Hindernis für Synergie bei Gruppenentscheidungen In hidden profile decision-making tasks, groups often fall short of their potential to make a better decision than each individual group member. Several reasons for this phenomenon have already been established, such as biases regarding both the content of the group discussion and the individual evaluation of information relevant to the decision. This thesis looks into a further aspect of individual information processing where biases could be detrimental to the quality of group decisions: The individual recall of information relevant to the task at hand. Specifically, two biases are propos... In Hidden Profiles gelingt es Gruppen häufig nicht, ihr Potenzial, bessere Entscheidungen als jedes ihrer Mitglieder zu treffen, zu erfüllen. Für dieses Phänomen wurden bereits verschiedene Ursachen ermittelt. Dazu gehören insbesondere Verzerrungen im Inhalt der Gruppendiskussion sowie der Bewertung von entscheidungsrelevanten Informationen durch die Gruppenmitglieder. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird nun ein weiterer Aspekt individueller Informationsverarbeitung untersucht, dessen Verzerrung einen nachteiligen Einfluss auf die Entscheidungsqualität von Diskussionsgruppen haben könnte: der i...

Text: Reform of the international institutions : the IMF, World Bank and the WTO The seemingly endless problems encountered by the IMF, WTO and World Bank provide major reasons for seeking reform. However, an additional impetus is the changing balance of economic power in the world. The volume begins with an overview of the Bretton Woods and international trading systems. Following this are discrete, in-depth discussions of the three institutions from American and European points of view. The authors emphasise the need for making the IMF and World Bank more regional in structure and, like the European Bank, more frugal in the lifestyles of their officials. Similarly, they call for a narrower focus in the mission of the World Bank and the IMF. In the case of the WTO, they call for a democratic reform of the organisation comprising participation by experts and, above all, better representation and support for Third World countries

Text: Solar cells : materials, manufacture and operation The capture and use of solar energy has been growing for many years, but only in recent times have advances in design and manufacture allowed us to see the incorporation of solar energy as a significant player in the renewable energy arena. Solar cells are at the heart of any photovoltaic system and in this book the various types are described and their characteristics reviewed. Going beyond materials, design and function, Solar Cells also covers their testing, monitoring and calibration thus providing a comprehensive account of current activity in this important field of research and industry. Solar Cells has been abstracted from the recent Practical Handbook of Photovoltaics by the same editors (ISBN 185617 3909. 2003: Elsevier) Internationally-respected contributors from industry and academia Abstracted from The Practical Handbook of Photovoltaics' by the same Editors A comprehensive source-book on all aspects of solar cells Principles of solar cell operation -- Ideal efficiencies / Peter T.
