Text: The Wider Economic Benefits of Transport : Macro-, Meso- and Micro-Economic Transport Planning and Investment Tools The standard cost-benefit analysis of transport infrastructure investment projects weighs a project’s costs against users’ benefits. This approach has been challenged on the grounds that it ignores wider economic impacts of such projects. At this International Transport Forum Round Table, leading academics and practitioners addressed these concerns and examined a range of potential approaches for evaluating wider impacts – negative as well as positive. They concluded that for smaller projects, it is better to focus on timely availability of results, even if this means forgoing sophisticated analysis of wider impacts. For larger projects or investment programs, customized analysis of these effects is more easily justifiable. Creating consistent appraisal procedures is a research priority.

Text: Thinking the sculpture garden : art, plant, landscape "This innovative book poses two, deceptively simple, questions: what is a sculpture garden, and what happens when you give equal weight to the main elements of landscape, planting and artwork? Its wide-ranging frame of reference, including the USA, Europe and Japan, is brought into focus through Tremenheere Sculpture Garden, Cornwall, with which the book begins and ends. Effectively less than 15 years old, and largely the work of one man, Tremenheere affords an opportunity to examine as work-in-progress the creation of a new kind of sculpture garden. Beginning with a historical overview, the book traverses multiple ways of seeing and experiencing sculpture gardens, culminating in an exploration of their relevance as 'cultural ecology' in the context of globalisation, urbanisation and climate change. The thinking is non-dualist and broadly aligned with New Materialisms and Material Feminisms to explore our place as humans in the non-human world on which we depend. Eminent contributors, including John Dixon Hunt, George Descombes, Bernard Lassus and David Leatherbarrow, approach the issues through practices and theories of landscape architecture; garden and art making, history and writing; and philosophy. Richly illustrated with over 100 images, including a colour plate section, the book will primarily appeal to those engaged in professional or academic research, along with sculpture garden visitors, who will find new and surprising ways of experiencing plants and art in natural and urban settings"--

Text: Chapter 21 Economics of Defense in a Globalized World In a world continuously beset by conflict and violence, the positive study of international security and defense has developed rapidly over the past decade as a cohesive discipline within economics. Part of the cause for this trend is the revolutionary effects of globalization and its new challenges to world security and stability. The challenges to security now come from new sources; they threaten new dangers, and require new instruments and concepts from us. The field of play for defense economics has thus greatly increased, but the opportunity to exploit new insights from throughout economics grown accordingly. This essay aspires to show how the recent developments in models of international political economy relate to study of this phenomenal evolution of the world's strategic situation and challenges to its safety. Here I give one perspective on the contributions expected of defense economics in a globalized world where old patterns of thinking risk obsolescence. Emphasis is focused on (a) how the field is changing, and the relation between new security challenges and required new analytic approaches, (b) how developing ideas about conflict, predation and governance have entered into and greatly influenced defense economics, and (c) how this raises questions over what should be retained from study of earlier eras and what discarded.
